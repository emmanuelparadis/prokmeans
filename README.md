# prokmeans

This package has functions to perform classification with probabilistic k-means algorithms. There are two methods:

- probabilistic k-means under a multivariate normal distribution with heterogeneous variances (function `pkm`)

- k-means with possible constrained memberships for observations with known memberships (function `kmeansConstr`)
